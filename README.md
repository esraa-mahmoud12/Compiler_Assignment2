# Compiler_Assignment2

Create SDD for a CFG that generates the language {a,b}* such that the start variable has 
an attribute check whose value is 1 if the generated string is of the form uv where |u| = |v|
and the number of as in u is strictly greater than the number of as in v. Otherwise, the value
of Check is 0.
